    <h1>HELLO</h1>
    <p>This is my first website ever created, and I am happy that I get to try it.
        I published this website so -name- can also see, it's so cooool. Anyways, I think
        that I should add a link? I'll add one right <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Here</a>
         It is a surprise website, and you should click on it. Hint, it leads to Amazon.
         I learned how to publicly publish a website and I am super happy about it.
         Anyways, goodbye. I should go now...
    </p>
    <h2>GOODBYE</h2>
